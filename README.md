# What is Reactjs?
**React** is javascript library that can be used to build and maintain stateless,stateful user interfaces.It provides a way to declare and define UI into reusable components and these components displays data as it changes over time.

# Why Reactjs over other Frontend frameworks?
* **React** apps use virtual DOM that allows developers to virtually update changes without rewriting the entire HTML doc
* It renders updates faster and ensures faster performance
* The component-driven architecture of React lets devs re-use components, saving development time, and cost
* Full backward compatibility, and smaller bundle size
* **React** uses virtual DOM and one-way data binding  which makes bundle size smaller and faster
* **React** allows isolated debugging, which helps developers achieve appâ€™s stability. 
* **React** is a library, and we can integrate it into any project (even if it is made with Angular)  while **Angular** is a framework.
